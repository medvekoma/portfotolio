    <h2>
        What is this site?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This site is an alternative <a href="http://flickr.com" title="flickr">flickr</a>
            viewer, aiming to help photographers showcase their portfolio and find inspiration
            in the works of other photographers.</li>
        <li>It also features a recommendation engine, which - based on what one marks as favorite
            - suggests other photos of interest. </li>
        <li>The application is designed to increase the visibility of the original flickr site.
            Photos are only shown in their small size, and they all link back to the original
            flickr page of the photo, where users can contact the photographer, comment on photos,
            etc.</li>
        <li>The site is developed as an <a href="https://github.com/medvekoma/portfotolio"
            title="github">open source project</a> by @Html.ActionLink("medvekoma", "photos", "photo", new { id = "medvekoma" }, null).
            Feel free to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/mail/write/?to=27725019@N00">contact us</a>
            with any of your questions, comments or concerns. </li>

    <h2>
        Copyright information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All images shown on this site are copyrighted by their respective owners. The owners
            can be contacted directly through their flickr page by clicking on any image.</li>
        <li>The site does not store images and personal data, and it does not reference any
            user or photo specifically. It is merely a viewer application: it reflects whatever
            flickr provides it for every request. It is like a different skin for a photostream.
        </li>
        <li>The site uses a technology called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_linking"
            title="inline linking">inline linking</a> to show the images stored on flickr's
            servers. According to international law, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_linking#Copyright_law_issues_that_inline_linking_raises"
                title="copyright issues">this is not a copyright infringement</a>. Nevertheless,
            we are ready to quickly remove your pictures (see below how).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Why can I see my photos here?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If you have public photos on flickr, they can appear on this site. As an alternative
            flickr viewer, it reflects whatever flickr provides it, changes on flickr are automatically
            reflected on this site.</li>
        <li>The site uses the official flickr API for querying the pictures - just like hundreds
            of other third party applications do. This application is fully compliant with the
            terms of use of flickr API: all images link back to the original Flickr page - so
            there can be no misunderstanding about the image origin, author or copyright. You
            can also read the official Flickr FAQ about this <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/website/#180"
                title="FAQ">here</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/website/#181" title="FAQ2">
                    here</a>. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Still, I don't want my photos here!</h2>
    No problem. Please choose from the options below:
    <ol>
        <li><span class="highlight">Opt out from flickr API.</span> You can opt out from flickr
            API searches by checking both the second and third checkbox on your <a href="http://www.flickr.com/account/prefs/optout/?from=privacy">
                flickr privacy page</a>. This will make your profile page unavailable on all
            sites based on flickr API (including portfotolio). This is a recommended step if
            you are concerned about your privacy, as it will hide you from most applications
            based on flickr API. However, because of the specifics of flickr API, some of your
            pictures might still appear in groups, and other people's favorite lists.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Self service (quickest).</span> You can hide yourself and
            your pictures completely from this application on the
            @Html.ActionLink("settings page", "show", "settings", null, new { rel = "nofollow" }).
            In order to verify your identity, we will ask you to log in with your flickr account
            and authorize portfotolio.net for read access. This process is safe, as it goes
            through your flickr page, we don't even get your credentials. You can revoke the
            permissions given at any time.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Customer service.</span> If you don't want to log in with
            your flickr account, and authorize portfotolio.net with read-only access, you can
            <a href="http://www.flickr.com/mail/write/?to=27725019@N00">send us a flickr mail</a>
            and we will add you to the opt-out list manually. We try to process these requests
            as quickly as possible.</li>
    </ol>
